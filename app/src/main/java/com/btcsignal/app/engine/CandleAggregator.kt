/**
 * Builds the currently-forming 5-minute BTCUSDT candle from a sequential stream of
 * CLOSED 1-minute candles (spec section 5), and emits Checkpoint A / Checkpoint B events
 * exactly at the moments the Strategy Database defines them (immediately after the 1st
 * and 2nd 1-minute sub-candles close — meta.hard_constraints.checkpoints). This same
 * class drives both LiveMonitoringService (fed by the Binance WebSocket) and
 * BacktestEngine / HistoricalReplay (fed by historical REST klines in chronological
 * order), which is how spec section 39's Live/Backtest consistency requirement is met
 * for candle-timing logic specifically.
 *
 * A 5-minute candle is only ever reported as closed once all 5 of its constituent
 * 1-minute candles have actually been observed — if data is missing, no
 * FiveMinuteCandleClosed event fires for that period (spec section 27, data integrity).
